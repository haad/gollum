As a first stage we need to become familiar with OpenStack and identify parts of it which will need to be ported to BSD platform. 
On other side we want to see if Openstack is ready for production and can be used in our setup.  Therefore our first initial task 
is to install latest version of OpenStack to Linux machine. Later after installation we can identify parts of system which will 
need to be ported to BSD.

1. Install and configure OpenStack on Linux machine. Duration 2-3 weeks
2. Do initial testing to see if OpenStack can be used in production in it\'s current state. Duration 2-3 weeks.
   After this stage we need to make a decision if we are going with OpenStack or we are going to roll out our own API.
3. Identify parts of OpenStack which need to be ported Duration 1 week.
4. Start actual port We can say how much work it will require now, just because we haven't tested OpenStack yet. But my rough idea 
   is that it can take 16-18 weeks.

=== Price

I think that 250$ for a week during stage 1 and 2 should be enough. I will be able to work on it for 16-20h per week.

=== The First stage of changes


Initial installation will be done on our server with Linux and XEN to test similar setup like we will use with NetBSD.Storage 
server will be placed on different machine and will try to use iSCSI for disk sharing over ethernet network. Master servers will be 
placed on separate machines to make our testing solution more similar to real setup.

=== Definition of milestones


Be able to use and test OpenStack based cloud on Linux.

=== Time frame


This stage will took me 2-3 weeks. Most of the time we will spent by installing and configuring OpenStack environment.
